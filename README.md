Artillery Sidewinder X4 Pro/Plus screen service for Klipper

From Tortillery firmware for Artillery Sidewinder X4 Pro/Plus (also S1) 3D printers this is the standalone KlipperLCD service.

Unzip the archive into the user directory and follow README.txt for installation instructions.

Note: it works also for X4 Pro but you have to change the Screws Tilt Adjust points.

This software works also on TwoTrees SK1 with custom firmware.
